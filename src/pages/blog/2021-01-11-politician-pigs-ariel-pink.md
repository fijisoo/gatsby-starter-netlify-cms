Donald Trump is banished on most popular Social Media services, pandemic still reaps the harvest and Ariel Pink had just removed from the contracted label because of attending Capitol Protest. Welcome in 2021! Let me take a look at Ariel Pinks's situation because that one touched me the most.

This is something dangerous in valuating Music and in general Art through the prism of artists life/decisions/thoughts. Music was always a part of expressing ourselves in some way untouchable. Art helps us find each other without looking at differences, where we could always search for beauty and humanity. But sadly some people found their place to seed suspicions, fear, and indifference just to acquiring their own needs.

There is no place in my heart where I might try to look at beauty another way that it appears. Don't hide your sensitivity for life, experiencing and finding people close your boundaries. And let music expose all of that to what's close to your heart.
