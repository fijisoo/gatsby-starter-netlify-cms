Donald Trump is banished on most popular Social Media services, pandemic still reaps the harvest and Ariel Pink had just removed from contracted label because of attending Capitol Protest. Welcome in 2021! And from all those three Ariel Pink took most of my attention..

This is something dangerous in valuate Music and in general Art through the prism of artists life/decisions/thoughts. Music was always a part of expressing ourself in some way untouchable. Art helps us finding each other without looking at differences, where we could always search for beauty and humanity. But sadly some people found there place to seed suspicions, fear and indifference just to acquiring own needs.

There is no place in my heart which may try to look at beauty other way that it appears. Don't hide your sensitivity for life, experiencing and finding people close your boundaries. And let music expose all of that what's close your heart.
