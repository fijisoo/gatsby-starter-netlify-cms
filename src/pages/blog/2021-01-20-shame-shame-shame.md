And here comes Shame. I love those kids. They reminds me somehow that everything you're struggling with is just a wall behind which lays all your dreams. So today was a snow day here, and they pushed me to go sledding. There is no need to worry much about everything. You know... sometimes the best option is just to let everything go as it comes to you. Collect all experiences as it was in your childhood. Be curious even about the same things but test them on different age levels. I really appreciate such impulses in my life. There should be more of that. Wish them all great :)

Best track on the new album: 6/1 with transition to the next one.
